# ShardDemo
Demo application for CVForge Shards.
Contains a sample Shard and a class for usage and protoyping outside of ImageJ.
All Shards must implement the CVForgeShard interface and contain only static methods.
Export the created Shard as a jar and give it the file extension ".shard.jar" to allow CVForge to recognize it.
